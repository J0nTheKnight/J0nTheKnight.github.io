            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>I am a Computer Science student and a Veteran. I am an entry level programmer with a desire to learn
                and grow.<br><br>

                I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning from those around me. Clean code is something I strive
                to create in every project I work on, even personal projects.<br><br>

                I have worked as a Weather Technician in the Air Force. Managing risk and making sure to look at the
                big picture are things I've learned in this role that I feel would make me a valuable member of any
                team. I was trained in 6 different positions allowing me to be among the most versatile members of
                the team.

            <h1>Background</h1>
            <p><strong>Java</strong>: My studies have mainly focused on using Java to tackle OOP-based problems. Currently learning everything I can find that is Java based to take these lessons into more languages and concepts.<br><br>

                <strong>Critical Problem Solving</strong> - I've made many threat based decisions to protect assets and
                personnel.
                Including tornado warnings to allow people to shelter in place. One such event required me to issue a
                tornado warning for my own base. I stayed behind to monitor the tornado and ensure the warning was
                properly received and acted on.<br><br>

                <strong>Quality Assurance Manager</strong> - I was the QA Manager for my unit during my time with the
                618th AOC.
                During
                my time as QA manager errors in forecasts was reduced by 50% by revamped our QA process and ensuring
                there was proper accountability and feedback.<br><br>

                <strong>Versatile and Trainable</strong> - I was trained in 6 different positions with different responsibilities over my years in the Air Force. Weather Forecaster, Points Forecaster, Weather Floor Manager, Mission Weather Services, Weather Graphics Forecaster, Flight Weather Briefer. This allowed me to be a very versatile member of my team.<br><br>

                <strong>Punctual and Dependable</strong> - For 5.5 Years in my time in the air force I never once missed a deadline or commitment in my duties.
