        <h1>About</h1>
        <p>
            I am a Computer Science student and a Veteran. I am an entry level programmer with a desire to learn
            and grow.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning from those around me. Clean code is something I strive
            to create in every project I work on, even personal projects.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have worked as a Weather Technician in the Air Force. Managing risk and making sure to look at the
            big picture are things I've learned in this role that I feel would make me a valuable member of any
            team.
