                            <span style="font-weight: bold">Java</span> - My studies have mainly focused on using Java
                            to tackle OOP-based problems. Currently learning everything I can find that is Java based to
                            take these lessons into more languages and concepts.

                            shelter in place. One such event required me me to issue a tornado warning for my own
                            base. I stayed behind to monitor the tornado and ensure the warning was properly
                            recieved and acted on.
